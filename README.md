# researchdata.se-polar-sitemap

Code to generate a sitemap.xml to enable [Polar Data Search](https://search.polder.info/) to harvest metadata about polar datasets from [Researchdata.se](researcheata.se)

## Status:
**2025-08-19** - Lists only datasets in the [Icebreaker Oden](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/collection/icebreaker-oden) dataset collection. Note that there is no API to get the list of records for a collection (not that I could find via https://api.researchdata.se/oai-pmh?verb=ListSets at any rate) so we scrape the web-site. Obviously, this is fragile, but a first step!
